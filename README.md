# Simon Says

This is the repository for my Simon Says project with 3D-printing, lasercutting and Arduino. I made this with the intention to use it in a geocache. The box is closed by default and will only open when you complete the Simon Says Color game. The program included has 7 levels, which is actually quite challenging!

The box is held shut with a magnet and a servo controlled bar that slides into a bracket. When the box opens (upon completing the game) the servo not only slides the bar out of the bracket, it also pushes against a barrier to overcome the magnetic force, and thus open the box.

The CAD files are available in the CAD folder and the STL/DXF files are in the OUTPUT folder
